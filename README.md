Using a dataset of US county-level mortality, we plan on analyzing mortality rates by state and compare with the alcohol consumption rates in states for several different causes of death.


Other data analyses to consider: 
Correlation between average alcohol consumption and mortality rate?
Between different causes of death?
Transport injuries & alcohol consumption?
Correlation or outliers by state/region?
Correlation over the corresponding years of data?
