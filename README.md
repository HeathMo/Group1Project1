**Project Description:**

Our group analyzed mortality rates by state and compared them with the alcohol consumption volume per person in states for several different causes of death.



**Questions:**

* Is there a correlation between ethanol consumption and various mortality rates?
* Correlation between average alcohol consumption and mortality rate?
* Correlation over the corresponding years of data?



**Data Sources:**

[Consumption of alcohol per capita in each of 50 states + DC from 1970 - 2019](https://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/surveillance117/pcyr1970-2019.txt )

[Mortality rates by state and county for 21 categories in 8 different years from 1980 - 2014](https://www.kaggle.com/IHME/us-countylevel-mortality )

Correlation of alcohol consumption and mortality types

* Strongest positive correlation = Cirrhosis

* Strongest negative correlation = Diabetes and Cardiovascular
